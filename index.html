                The importance of Deep Breathing
            </h2>
            <h3 class='paratitle'>Breathing helps reduce stress</h3>
            <p class='normaltext'>
                When you become anxious or stressed your brain releases cortisol which is a hormone related to stress. When you take deep breaths it slows your heart rate down and more oxygen enters the blood stream which helps the brain relax. Breathing also increases endorphins which also lower stress and anxiety.

            <h3 class='paratitle'>Breathing to improve your health</h3>
            <p class='normaltext'>
                Breathing improves blood flow and also cleanses the body of toxins. When your body has the proper amount of oxygen it carries and absorbs nutrients and vitamins more efficiently. This improves immunity from illness.</p>
